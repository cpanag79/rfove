RFOVE is completely unsupervised, operates without any assumption or prior knowledge on the objectâ€™s shape and extends and improves the Decremental Ellipse Fitting Algorithm (DEFA) [1]. Both RFOVE and DEFA solve the multi-ellipse fitting problem by performing model selection that is guided by the minimization of the Akaike Information Criterion on a suitably defined shape complexity measure. However, in contrast to DEFA, RFOVE minimizes an objective function
that allows for ellipses with higher degree of overlap and, thus, achieves better ellipse-based shape approximation.
